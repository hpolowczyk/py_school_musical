    "\n",
    "* Overall, more spending per student did not translate into better test performance. Based on the analysis, the performance drop occurs when spending per student is over \\\\$615 and gets worse as more money is spent. The performance in the lower buckets (under \\\\$590) and (\\\\$590-615) is very similar with minimal variance amoung all performance metrics, while there is a noticable decline in performance even amoung the third and fourth buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The analysis shows that schools with under 2,000 students (i.e. small) significantally outperform those with over 2,000 students (i.e medium and large). This difference is very visible when looking at passing performance in math (94% vs 72% vs 66%), passing performance in reading (97% vs. 84% vs. 81%) and over passing performace (95% vs. 78% vs 74%). The one score that varies the least among the different sizes is Reading Score with only a 3% range (84% from small school size to 81% from large school size).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a whole, students in charter schools out-performed students in district schools across all metrics. All top performing schools were charter schools and the bottom five were all district schools. While the average spend per student is lower for charter schools (\\\\$598.78) than that of public schools (\\\\$643.09), the average amount of students in public schools is more than twice the average of charter schools (4,063 vs. 1,717). This size difference could have an impact on performance has students in charter schools may be receiving more attention from teachers due to smaller class sizes. However, further research will have to be done to confirm this.\n",
